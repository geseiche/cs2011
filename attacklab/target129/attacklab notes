Phase 1:
- fill buffer size of getbuf with random
- take address of touch1 and reverse it 2 digits at a time
- concat with other files
cat ctarget.l1 | ./hex2raw | ./ctarget

Phase 2:
- fill buffer size of getbuf with random
- write the assembly to move cookie into %rdi and return to touch2
mov $0x117c81f7 $rdi
ret 
- put return addresses on stack
- find address of inserted code
- first return address should be address of inserted code

Phase 3:
- string representation of cookie is 49, 55, 55, 99, 56, 49, 102, 55, 0 (has new line)
	31 37 37 63 38 31 66 37 00
- same as above, but pass a string

Phase 4:
- line 53, 48 89 c7 c3, moves rax to rdi and returns
- line 2d, 58 90 90 c3, pops off the stack in rax and returns
